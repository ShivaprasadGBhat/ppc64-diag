$ make install

-------------
To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do

$ make tarball

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

$ rpmbuild -ba <path-to-spec-file>

Hacking
--------
All patches should be sent to the mailing list with linux-kernel style
'Signed-Off-By'. The following git commands are your friends:
- git commit -s
- git format-patch

You probably want to read the linux kernel Documentation/SubmittingPatches
as much of it applies to lsvpd.

Submitting patch
----------------
We use same mailing list for all Power Linux VPD and diagnostics projects
(ppc64-diag, libvpd, lsvpd, [lib]servicelog). It is common convention to
prefix your subject line with project name. This lets maintainer and other
developers more easily identify patches from patches targeted to other
projects. For example,

  Subject: [ppc64-diag PATCH 01/10] Summary phrase
