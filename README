You can build on Power Linux System.

$ make
$ make install

Building rpms
-------------
To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do

$ make tarball

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

$ rpmbuild -ba <path-to-spec-file>

Reporting issue
-----------------
Create a GitHub issue if you have any request for change, assuming one does
not already exist. Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce
if it is a bug.

How to contribute
-----------------
If you plan to submit the changes, submit a pull request based on top of
master. Include a descriptive commit message. Changes contributed should
focus on a single issue at a time to the extent possible.

Hacking
--------
The following workflow should work for you:
- Fork the repository on GitHub into your account.
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  This is usually the master branch.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes and make sure
  all tests pass.
- Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Include a descriptive commit message, and each commit should have
  linux-kernel style 'Signed-Off-By'.
- Submit a pull request to this repository.

You probably want to read the linux kernel Documentation/SubmittingPatches
as much of it applies to ppc64-diag.
